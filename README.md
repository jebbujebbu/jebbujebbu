# 👋 Hi, I'm Jenni

🎓 I am a third-year Information Technology engineering student. Before starting my studies in IT, I worked as a teacher helping immigrants learn Finnish as a second language and teaching native Finnish to students in vocational school. This experience helped me develop strong communication, problem-solving, and organizational skills.
